    // this is a comment in Javascript
    let a = "Hello world"; // l is position 9 start at 0 same as in Java
    console.log(a.substring(4,7));

    // what is z going to print?
    // watch for the " " because that is a string and will not evaluate the math

    // the difference between == and ===
    // not only is it a KBA question but it is important to know also 
    // === compares not only the value but the data type as well
    console.log("1" == 1 ); // true
    console.log("1" == "1"); //true
    console.log(1 == 1) // true
    console.log("1" === 1 ) // false (interview question == vs ===) 
    // strictly equals (3 equals) will check the datatype as well as the contents while == will only check contents.
    // They are called Loose Equal and Strict Equal
    console.log(1 === 1 ) // true

    // one difference between let and var is you can only define something
    // using let once in the same code block, with var it will allow more than once
    let abc = '123';
    abc = "something else";
    // let abc = "abc123"; // <--- this line is an error because abc is already defined
    // var will allow more than once in the same code block, also
    // this is bad practive to do this. use let instead of var
    var xyz = "123"
    var xyz = "abc";
    // error in kba if you try to use let and then let again it will cause an error
    console.log(xyz);

    // how to make an alert box in javascript
    // this can be nice for debugging
    alert("some message to popup");
    // be careful you use the word alert in the kba

    // about languages; a variable can be of any type;
    // JavaScript is a weakly typed language meaning a variable can be of any type and that type can change
    // Java is strontly typed laguage meaning the datatype must be specified at compile time and can not change
    // javaScript is a high level scripting language that is weakly typed kba question
    // No HTML in external javascript files
    // False! External javascript files can contain HTML
    // in javascript we can concatinate strings using the +
    let str = "Hello" + "world";
    console.log(str);
    // dates in javascript is very flexible; in java dates are very strict
    let date1 = new Date("Thu Jan 29 2001 17:34:41");
    let date2 = new Date("2024-01-29");
    // getMonth seem to think that January is 0 not 1
    console.log("Month = " + date1.getMonth());
    console.log("Month = " + date2.getMonth());
    console.log(date1.getMonth() === date2.getMonth());
    // getMonth returns a number between 0 and 11
    // why they made January month 0 is ???
    // Onclick event handler
    // continue and break works that same ways as it does in java

    // string work the same way they do in Java

    // this is a true statement: Javascript is "safe" in that the browser does not allow 
    // direct access to the memory or CPU
    // common got you question: 
    let trick = 8 + "8";
    console.log(trick) // answer is 88 Number + string = string
    // getElementsByTagName - find elements in the document by their HTML tag
    // for example find all of the p tags
    // getElementById - finds an element by the id = " " attribute
    // we know that this will retrun a single element because id is unique

    // getElementsByName - finds all elements with name= " " attribute
    // most powerfull of all and most used querySelector - find all elements based on the CSS querySelector
    // querySelector will find the first element in the document; 
        // return a single value *** need to know for the KBA

    // you can subtract a string from a string
    // it is not causing a compile or run error
    // NaN means ... not a number; not an error because it will execute and give the response of not a number
        let q = "Hello" - "world";
        console.log(q);

    // for loops

        firstName : "Eric",
        lastName : "Heilig",

    // in mean loop over the keys
    for (let i in person ) {
        console.log(i + " = " + person[i]);

    // of is looping over the values of an array

    // continue= skip

// 2 ways of registering an event listener
// first is using the onClick = "funtion" on a html tag like we did in buttonclick.html
// second using the addEventListner method built into the javascript language, this method is available
// to use the addEventListner function first you have to query the element from the document
// then you use the addEventListner('click', functionToRun());
// listner...callback function

// ** If you want to spend time reading about and experimenting with splice () and slice ()
// True - Array.splice() changes the original array whereas Array.slice() does not

// 308.4 slide #28 talks about creating new HTML elements
// there are 2 ways of creating elements
// document.createElement('p'); this will create a p tag in the document - can make all tags
// createTextNode() // this only works for text nodes like a p tag
